Junit3 vs Junit4 - main difference was the introduction of annotations in junit4

@BeforeClass - used to execute a statement before all the test cases
@AfterClass - used to execute a statement after all the test cases 
@Test(timeout = 500)		- used to set timeout while executing the test
@Test(expected = illegalArgumentException.class)  - used to handle some exception during test execution



Mockito and Junit for unit testing

	- This mocking framework helps in the development of testable applications
	
	
When to use mockito?
	When a comoponent is to be tested, but that component is dependent on another comoponent which is under development
	When the real comoponents perform slowly, mock objects are used to perform the testing
	When there are any infra concerns which makes the testing impossible
	
What is a Stub?
	Stubs are objects holding predefined data and uses the data to give reponses during the tasks
	It can be referred to as an object that looks like real object with least number of methods
	They return the predefined outputs no matter what the inputs is 
	These stubs are used to reduce complexities that occur while creating the real objects
